# Charon
# Hi! And welcome to the glorious mess that is Charon!

### Few things worth mentioning:

<p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
mailbox.cpp is still in the works... And I could really use advice on how to improve it.
The applyMove and undoMove algorithms are unfinished. I wrote them in one shot and I 
haven't had time to look at them again.
   </p> 
  <li>
   <p>
There are multiple files that need to be deleted. Among these are empty cpp files and 
my crude List that I opted not to use.
   </p>
  </li> 
 </ol> 
</p>

### These are Charon's perft scores !!!
###### (Keep in mind that Charon is currently single-threaded and generates strictly-legal moves only.)
###### (Charon's node counts do not match those of popular engines that generate pseudo-legal moves.)
